campusTools
===========

These are simple scripts making your lives a bit easier, provided you're an RWTH Aachen student ;)

This should explain everything:

* ~$ campuscal.sh matrikelno password | somefancyicalendarimporter
* webcal://your.webserver/campuscal.php
* more to follow in the future, I'm open for contributions (github pull request)!

All tools are WTFPL licensed, see for further information: http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/
